      "content": "Our challenge is an evolution of the mass decentralized identity (DID) adoption challenge from Funding Round 6, connecting everything we are learning with the first Atala PRISM Pioneer Program cohort.\n\nThe second cohort of the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program will kick off once Catalyst Fund 7 is complete. Between now and then, any member of the Catalyst Community inspired to write a proposal will get access to the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program first cohort course materials on Canvas. Please submit your proposal on Ideascale, including your email address, to get an invitation to Canvas.\n\nWith this access, you'll join the growing Atala PRISM community. Our Atala PRISM product team and engineers will be available via a dedicated Discord channel. Inclusion in our Professional Services Group governance framework foundry. Access to fireside chats with the top leaders in the SSI space, where we'll discuss trends, use cases, and much more. In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization."

      "content": "Interoperability\n\nMost digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.\n\nThe best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.\n\nWe encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.\n\nSelf-governance of Emergent Communities\n\nDAO Governance in Practice\n\nNew legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.\n\nWe are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.\n\nThe proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.\n\nPatterns of Commoning\n\nWe draw inspiration from the work of the Trust Over IP Foundation and the principles from 'Patterns of Commoning.' We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.\n\nHow can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?\n\nWe are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.\n\nEducation, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives\n\nMany of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.\n\nWe need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:\n\n- For onboarding new experts and teachers\n- For people in the community to develop and grow\n- For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.\n\nWhen reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.\n\nCircular Supply Chain\n\nThe global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.\n\nSupply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:\n\n- Regenerative agriculture\n- Locally produced art\n- Other forms of local commerce\n\nOn the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.\n\nFor the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:\n\nSmall Producer Problem\n\nHow can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?\n\nFor example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the BeefChain project is supporting small ranchers.\n\nThere are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:\n\n- Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains\n- Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.\n\nThe Last-Mile Problem\n\nHow can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?\n\nThis challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We're looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.\n\nAn example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.\n\nHowever, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.\n\nAddressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap."
