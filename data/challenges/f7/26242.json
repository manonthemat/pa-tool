      "content": "As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in Latin America about blockchain technology and the Cardano protocol should be a priority for the Catalyst community. Providing the funding for those people who learn about our protocol to take advantage of the protocol and the support the community offers seems to be why we work together, doesn't it?\n\nWithin our community we have some outstanding people from Latin America working with us to grow the ecosystem. Let's give our fellow community members a funding category they can point to within their local communities as a means to take part in this revolution of technology.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of stake pools are based in North America and Europe. The Cardano protocol will be much more resilient and productive for people all around the world when the Catalyst community steps up and intentionally supports those who would like become a part of the stake pool network.\n\nSome of the Catalyst community's original members come from Latin America, let's capitalize on that initiative and bring more people from this wonderful part of the world into the Cardano ecosystem."

New SPOs forming?\n- What can we learn from funded proposals when it comes to building on the initial successfully funded proposals from this challenge setting?\n- Will applications be developed that might be useful in other parts of the world?\n- Will there be measurable improvement in the lives of people who are attracted to the Cardano ecosystem?"
