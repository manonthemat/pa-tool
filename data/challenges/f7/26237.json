Some of them are:\n\n- https://aragon.org\n- https://daostack.io\n- https://colony.io\n- https://www.molochdao.com\n- https://abridged.io\n- https://kleros.io\n\nCardano needs:\n\n1. Similar tools to offer competitive alternative to other chains.\n2. Additional not yet existing tools to put the blockchain in an advantage when new DAOs needs to evaluate which chain to use for their platforms."
