      "content": "Artificial Intelligence will be a driving force this century. It will be at least as big as cryptocurrencies and blockchains.\n\nThe Singularity community has put their trust in Cardano by voting overwhelmingly to risk the value of their AGI tokens by issuing new AGI tokens based on Cardano and moving swiftly from Ethereum to Cardano. We can reward that trust and recognize the risk they took by dedicating a community challenge to them and their field of endeavor.\n\nThe speed and efficiency of Cardano combined with the possibilities of SingularityNet will make a great partnership that sets both communities apart from other cryptocurrencies/tokens and drives enormous growth and value.\n\nAlso… I want a world for my kids and community where Artificial Intelligence's goals are as beneficial and ethical as Cardano's"

No longer must AI technology exist in silos, only capable of operating within a specific company, infrastructure, or industry.\n- Sophia, the world's most expressive robot, is one of our first use cases."
