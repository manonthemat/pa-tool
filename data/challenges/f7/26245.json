This is of high value in the still very much hype-driven general Crypto space. With SPOs, the CARDANO Community can get both: Even more decentralization AND stability and professionalism at the same time.\n\nOn this bases, many new ideas and service can emerge, such as\n\n- Secure and censorship-resilient data storage\n- KYC related service and access hubs\n- Well, for sure many, many more ideas and opportunities\n\nIn case of success, I can also see this as a recurring challenge setting, driving and optimising the economic well-being of our SPO's and utilizing all their today's and future capabilities in a most creative way."
