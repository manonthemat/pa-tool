They assess proposals and by doing that, provide feedback to proposers to improve their ideas for the next fund, and support voter on deciding which proposals are more ready and have higher chances of being successful and impact the Cardano ecosystem.\nBy improving the assessing process, we improve the whole Catalyst process as a consequence.
