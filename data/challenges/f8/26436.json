            "content": "The success of Bitcoin spawned numerous off-shoot experiments and the arrival of Ethereum increased tribalism. As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy \"maximalism\" emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.\nThere are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It's a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities. Missing awareness of each other's doings forces us to duplicate our efforts. When we are separate we are not able to learn from each other's achievements or failures.\nCardano has a strong, open and inclusive community, let's make this a real super power and let's be the first ones to forge strong bonds. Let's create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another. Let's go out there, break the silos and build bridges and presence between us."

Its unique crowdloan mechanism invites the community of token holders to voice out which projects should be implemented first. The Nominated Proof of Stake network offers advanced governance mechanisms as well.\nhttps://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-video-tutorials\nAcademically impressive and technologically sound Algorand has a unique consensus mechanism Pure Proof of Stake and we can learn a lot from their governance model.\nhttps://www.algorand.com/technology\nBoasting a throughput beyond 4,500 tps and near-instant finality, the EVM-compatible Avalanche has quickly become the go-to choice for multiple DeFi projects. It has an innovative multi-chain architecture that utilizes both DAG and Blockchain technologies.\nhttps://www.avax.network\nOther examples could be e.g. Fantom (https://fantom.foundation/intro-to-fantom), Solana (https://solana.com/ecosystem), IOTA (https://www.iota.org/), Polygon (https://polygon.technology/get-started), Nervos (https://www.nervos.org) or any community that is ready for multi-chain reality.

Our proposed challenge is intentionally left open ended and it welcomes a multitude of different solutions. Worthwhile ideas submitted in this challenge should help grow and improve the Cardano and Catalyst community in the near term (next 6-9 months).\nThis challenge is therefore aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals: \n\tIt helps prepare people to make contributions to the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem.\n\tIt helps turn Cardano into an open source project recognized also beyond our community.\n\tIt accelerates the growth and evolution of our developer & app ecosystem by inviting contributions from the rest of the blockchain space.\nThe budget of $400,000 USD is a moderate 2,5% of the total treasury allocation for Fund8. It should be sufficient to kickstart interoperability and cross-chain collaboration initiatives but might not be enough for any large scale infrastructure projects. Therefore, we encourage submission of \"minimum viable\" and \"proof of concept\" proposals that do include long-term vision and roadmap but which are initially scoped quite small."
