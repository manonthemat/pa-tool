            "content": "As well as Africa, I think we should also put significant focus on Cardano within India.\nIndia has a massive population of 1.4 billion.\n55% are under the age of 30yrs (Wikipedia, 2016 est.),There are a significant percentage of unbanked/rural people,worldpoverty.io notes 100 million Indians (7%) live in extreme poverty,Certain rural areas are already using Aadhaar Pay to pay for goods using their fingerprint (see https://www.payaadhar.in) ,More affluent areas are early adopters of new technologies and India has a lot of skilled IT people,Jio telecoms (3rd largest in the world) has 405 million mobile subscribers (Wikipedia, 2019). So there is enough infrastructure and consumer devices in place to make this a serious market right away.\nHaving an India focused Catalyst challenge/fund would be very useful to gather teams and ideas and get the Cardano ball rolling in India.\nI am not Indian and have no connection to India, but I think that Cardano could be useful to help solve issues that they face and also to grow the Cardano eco-system.\nOn the surface issues in India might appear similar to Africa or South America, and there will be some overlap, but ideally local people identifying and solving local issues is best.\nEmurgo has an office in India, but not sure what they are up to.\nIT in India is well established with a large pool of talent and skills available - we need to let them know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding.\nThis proposal is intended to focus on India within a Fund8 challenge, with that challenge attracting actionable proposals to grow the community of developers and educators."
