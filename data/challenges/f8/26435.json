The 2017 Findex report shows that about a quarter of unbanked adults live in the poorest 20 percent of households in their country. Proposals in Nation Building Dapps will be able to help provide digital identities to these people and help them out of poverty. We want to encourage Cardano blockchain solutions that will be able to provide nations with decentralized solutions to their infrastructure by eliminating a single point of failure, protecting national, corporate, and individual data, property, and assets.\nDapp proposals should cover foundational Registry solutions, namely:,National ID & Civil Registry, Property Registration, Medical & Vaccination, Education Census, Revenue Service, Business Incorporations, Elections Voting, Customs & Border Control, Criminal Records, Employment Census, Vehicle Registration, Licensing & Certifications.\nhttps://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf\nProposers to review IOHK/ EMURGO Atala Prism solutions before hand along with reference use cases on integrated registry systems applications currently implemented across wealthy nations.\nit is further advised Proposers to obtain a knowledge base over research done in the past three decades unraveling the \"mysterious\" causes of poverty in third world countries by the economist Hernando de Soto. The attached book, \"The Mystery of Capital,\" is a great reference to get into context for anyone involved in developing proposals for this challenge."
