            "content": "As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community's support and build on or use the Cardano network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include East Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let's build upon that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA call to action; Activate the Cardano community's ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with\u2014allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed."
