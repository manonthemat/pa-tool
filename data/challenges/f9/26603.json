With Blockfrost, developers can start doing what they love \u2764\uFE0F, without the need for running and maintaining additional infrastructure and tooling themselves. At the moment, we have more than 10,000 developers already onboarded in our Blockfrost.io hosted platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are also working on open-sourcing Blockfrost API backend, making it possible for the community to further build and provide the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis challenge is set to create a thriving developer ecosystem around Blockfrost, encouraging not only more developers to build on Blockfrost but also build the Blockfrost ecosystem as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuiding questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can we drive new developers to Cardano with Blockfrost?\r\nCan we acquire already existing developers from the Crypto space?\r\nHow can we make Blockfrost more decentralized and robust?\r\nCan we provide guidance to existing developers on how to build more secure applications on Cardano?\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible directions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of new frameworks \r\nResearch of new concepts\r\nEducational material\r\nContributing to blockfrost.dev documentation portal\r\nBlog posts, articles and tutorials\r\nSDKs for NFT minting and NFT management\r\nDashboard and UI alternatives\r\nAuditing of existing code base\r\nIncentive schemes for developers and providers\r\nCollaboration to improve interoperability within existing tools in the ecosystem\r\nHackathons\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen-source solutions are strongly preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blockfrost team will provide technical support and guidance as well as free developer subscriptions to all winners of this challenge.\r\n\r\n"
