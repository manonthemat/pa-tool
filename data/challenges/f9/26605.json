            "content": "Cardashift aims to empower every human being to build a sustainable world through Cardano protocols. Our first product is a community-run launchpad to fund and accelerate impact projects. Helping these start-ups to monetize the impact they generate is a hot topic for us. \r\n\r\nThe idea of leveraging blockchain technology for this purpose has been further explored by other protocols. The most famous example is the IXO protocol with the creation of \"Impact Tokens\". These aim at representing \"real world outcome states that people care about\". The tokenization of verified outcomes through the ixo protocol thus transforms traditional certificate-based representations of outcomes (e.g carbon reduction certificates, education certificates, vaccination certificates, biodiversity certificates or any other certified outcome state) into tradable and investable digital assets. \r\n\r\nHowever the ecosystem is still nascent and the question remains opened: \r\n\r\nWhat kind of tools, interacting on-and-off-chain, can we develop to measure and value impact financially?\r\n\r\nThis challenge combines several themes in one. Monetizing impact requires the development of an entire ecosystem:\r\n\r\nActors capable of defining criteria (standard) on what an impact means in different context (education, carbon cycle, biodiversity, etc) and\/or geography\r\nServices and methods to issue impact credentials in a decentralized way with a peer-to-peer and expert review process\r\nCertification bodies for analyzing and validating the data points provided by impact-oriented projects\r\nMechanisms to give a financial value to impact - reflections on tokenizing impact\r\nOn-chain tools for recording impact proofs and bringing more transparency and traceability\r\nOn-chain marketplaces to connect impact-oriented projects with potential buyers (corporations, states organizations, funds) for their impact proofs\r\n\r\n\r\nThese development paths are obviously interconnected and the research can mix blockchain and non-blockchain approaches."

            "title": "Why is it important?",
            "content": "Today, there is a gap between the perceived value for society of impact projects and the financial value they capture.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this inconsistency, two key steps are necessary:\r\n\r\nImpact valuation: we must be able to measure and validate the tangible contribution of a project from a social and\/or environmental point of view, by developing new solutions of measurement, analysis and\/or traceability. The ability to organize governance models through blockchain can help provide differentiated and locally adapted approaches\/standards to impact measurement\r\nImpact monetization: in the discussion report from the Impact Management Project (IMP)\u2019s Practitioner Community, the experts expressed \u201Cthe need to translate impact into a comparable value to make it possible for analysts to incorporate impact considerations\u201D. Monetizing impact can be an initial incentive to drive investments and resources towards projects that meet the environmental and social challenges of our time. Beyond that, giving an universal and comparable value to impact provides more transparency and performance tracking on this topic. Cardano\u2019s blockchain technology provides a powerful, permissionless and auditable system for recognising new value creation mechanisms for stakeholders\r\n\r\n\r\nThese topics of valuation and monetization were already present in the definition of impact investments set by the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) in 2009: \u201CImpact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.\u201D\r\n\r\nSince then, many impact-oriented actors have been working hard on improving the standards and valuation tools.\r\n\r\nCardano can be a gamechanger on this worldwide mission for saving the planet and humanity by bringing three key elements to the infrastructure: traceability, transparency and liquid marketplaces."

So, we want to focus on impact-oriented solutions and not projects that prioritize only ESG criteria. Success for this challenge:\r\n\r\nDiscovers innovative ways for impact-oriented projects to create financial value out of their impact generation, notably by issuing impact tokens. \r\nIncreases transparency and traceability on the impact generated by a specific project.
