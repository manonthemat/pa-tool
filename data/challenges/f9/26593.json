Additionally, projects that are better suited for the account-style method (instead of UTXO) also exist, and we want these projects to be usable from the Cardano ecosystem as well.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this part of the roadmap, many efforts are currently underway such as KEVM, IELE, ERC20 Converter and Milkomeda to name a few. These projects are reaching the point where they are mature enough for people to deploy using them or build tooling for them and so it's time to start welcoming projects to Cardano.\r\n\r\nYou can hear Charles talk about the importance of this in his video \"The Island, The Ocean and the Pond\" (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k8a6tX53YPs)"
