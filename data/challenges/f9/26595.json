What are the core differences between the proposal being presented and those existing ones and why will that provide impact to the ecosystem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTechnical requirements - Does the Cardano ecosystem have the right tools, libraries and SDKs for the idea to be feasible? What needs to be introduced or improved for the proposal to fully reach its potential?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ecosystem maturity requirements - Why is this product or integration suitable for execution right now? Are there enough pieces of infrastructure, applications or other integrations available that would be needed for this suggested proposal to have a strong chance of gaining adoption? For instance, if you were making a professional social network DApp, do the right identity tools and wallets exist to make a professional network feasible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDING CATEGORIES BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFunding Categories is an approach to doing funding categorisation that will welcome all ideas, maximize the amount of ideas submitted and reduce the effort for all stakeholders in the Catalyst process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFunding categories also help remove the existing issues with challenge settings. They help to prevent duplicate challenge settings, remove challenges created by self interest, reduce the need for deep knowledge of the ecosystem from challenge proposal teams and also removes an easy entry point for malicious actors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe full documentation for Catalyst Funding Categories can be found here: https:\/\/catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io\/catalyst-funding-categories\/ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t7 funding categories have been documented to cover all forms of ideas and proposals. All proposals can be found here - https:\/\/linktr.ee\/cardanopace \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe budget weighting for the 7 categories has been determined using a community governance process. The voting results for this process can be found here - https:\/\/catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io\/catalyst-funding-categories\/community-votes\/fund-8-categories-budget-weighting\/voting-results-fund-8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn closing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe potential opportunities that Catalyst can provide to genuine dapp and product developers have increased substantially. A 32x increase in the span of a year.\r\n\r\n\tAt the same time, it\u2019s now up to the Catalyst community to drive the direction of the experiment by setting the challenges that provide funding opportunities for developers.\r\n\r\n\tWe, in the Catalyst community, need to change our perspective on the nascent experiment and enable it to grow up.\r\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s time for the Catalyst community to step up and provide developers with the challenges that will unlock the funds they need to be able to develop for, and on Cardano with confidence.\r\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s time to think big!"
